                    <ul>
                        <p><strong>Educational History from the 19th Century</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            The story of OsloMet begins in the 19th century with a focus on midwifery education, where SÃ¸rine Eriksen Aaseide applies for admission in 1843. The education evolves over time, and today midwives are still trained at OsloMet.
                        </li>
                        <p><strong>Establishment of Key Study Areas</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            Key study areas such as engineering, nursing, and physiotherapy were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in line with society's
                        </li>
                        <p><strong>Women in Education</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            The role of women in education is highlighted, with the creation of programs in women's professions influenced by the contemporary women's movement. Women still dominate welfare professions, while men choose engineering and technical fields.
                        </li>
                        <p><strong> Educational Development After World War II</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            After World War II, new disciplines emerge, especially in health and social sciences, aligning with the needs of a growing welfare state.
                        </li>
                        <p><strong>Knowledge Base and Collaboration with the Workforce</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            The educational knowledge base is developed in collaboration with the workforce and practical fields. Academic subjects like physics and engineering have also influenced education, gradually developing an independent knowledge base.
                        </li>
                        <p><strong>Journey Towards University Status</strong></p>
                        <li>
                            After the 1970s, education becomes part of a higher education system and is transformed into colleges. In 2018, the Oslo and Akershus University College achieves university status as OsloMet, with an increased focus on research and development, master's, and doctoral programs.
